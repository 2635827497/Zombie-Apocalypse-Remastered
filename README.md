---

**Zombie Apocalypse Remastered** is a recreation modpack from [Zombie Apocalypse](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/zombie-apocalypse-slow-zombies-by-forge-labs) originally by Forge Labs, focusing on a more balanced, progressive, and most importantly plug and play experience based on Zombie Apocalypse's modlist and configs.



Zombie Apocalypse Remastered highlights the most mentionable feature done mainly via CraftTweaker --- Overhauling every single tooltips of the guns to more detailed, accurate and nice-looking ones, currently it's not completely done yet, but more than half of them is available for English (US) and Simplified Chinese now. All the texts, if from actual item names, would honor the corresponding items' current names, so excluding the titles, it should be ok with other languages.
